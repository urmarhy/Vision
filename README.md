# Adriana Vision

**Adriana Vision** (or simply **Vision**) is an advanced terminal-style web interface built for maximum utility and control. Inspired by command-line environments, Vision is the evolution of Adriana Search — offering deep integration with tools, APIs, and AI to create a truly intelligent interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Cross-platform search (Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, and more)
- 💬 Conversational AI (Adriana Gen) with command support
- 📦 Open apps and services directly from terminal commands
- 🧮 Built-in calculators (standard, scientific, programmer)
- 🖼️ Image conversion and manipulation (format change, basic edits)
- 📁 File structure navigation (virtual)
- ⚙️ Expandable with custom commands and plugins

## 💡 Philosophy

Vision is built for power users who want everything at their fingertips. No distractions. Just fast, intelligent control over search, tools, and AI — in a terminal-styled environment.
